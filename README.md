# Project 3: PrioritizeIt

Group: The Boys
Members: John Salinas, Rahul Sharma, Taylor Vandenberg

Taylor Vandenberg: Renice/Priority Rahul Sharma: Scheduling John Salinas: Priority

Comments: Taylor Vandenberg - one struggle I had was learning how to actually write a new application instead of editing an existing one as well as setting flags and using the parser

Rahul Sharma - one struggle I had was implementing the Multilevel Algorithm from Zybooks. I instead had to use a queue based scheduling algorithm instead

John Salinas -

Priority branch contains a way to schedule and display tasks using a priority from 1-5 with the default value being 3
